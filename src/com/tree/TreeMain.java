	 *  General Tree Summary
	 *  1) Hierarchical data structure
	 *  2) Each node can only have one parent
	 *  3) A tree can only have one root node
	 *  4) A leaf node has no children
	 *  5) A singleton tree has only one node which is the root node
	 *  6) A subtree is a node and all of its descendants
	 *  7) An edge links nodes on the outside of a tree or subtree
	 *  8) A path is sequence of nodes required to go from one node to another
	 *  9) Cannot have a cyclic path
	 *  10) A root path is a path going from a node to the root
	 *  11) The depth of a node is the number of edges to the root
	 *  12) The height of a node is the max number of edges to the farthest leaf
	 *  13) The height of the root is the height of the tree
	 *  14) A level of a tree contains all of the nodes at the same depth
	 *  15) A node is an ancestor of another node if it is in the node's path
	 *  15) Ideal when things can contain other things or descend from other things
	 *   
	 *  Binary Search Tree Summary
	 *  1) Every node has 0, 1, or 2 children
	 *  2) Children are referred to as left child and right child
	 *  3) In practice, we use binary search trees 
	 *  4) A binary search tree is complete if:
	 *     a) Every level except the last level has two children
	 *     b) On the last level, all nodes are as left as possible
